## Description:
I wrote this program in 2012 after I just started programming. I wanted to test out my coding chops,
so I decided to write a program that simulates a Commandline Prompt interface. I included some built
in functionality and also expanded on it using a template based system.

Please note, this code does not reflect my current practices or programming style. I am simply sharing
this code because I enjoyed writing it 2 years ago, and I am still proud of the effort I put into it 
today, even though there are quite a few rough parts and things I would change. I have left it intact 
for posterity.

Enjoy!

## How To Use:

Compile all the files using gcc and run the executable.

If you would like to add a class's functionality to the Terminal, simply add the keyword in all caps
that you want to activate the class, and also include it in the case switch section in Terminal.cpp.
Then create a method in the class called start(string A[]). Array 'A' contains commandline arguments.

Please fork this project and add new functionality!
